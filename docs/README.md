## Terminology

- **Universal JSON Contract:** the shared request dispatch (`action`) and
  response envelope.
- **JSON Query Mode:** the backend builds a validated SELECT from
  client-supplied structure.
- **SQL Resource Mode:** the client runs a server-owned, read-only SQL file by
  ID, optionally with validated `execution` metadata.
- **Execution metadata:** the request's declaration of approved SQL Resource
  output columns, filter mappings, and default sort; never arbitrary SQL.
- **Write API:** single-object INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or UPSERT on a table
  named in the request.
- **Principal:** the authenticated caller (session user, API key, legacy key, or
  anonymous), whose role permissions decide every authorization.
- **Runtime configuration directory:** the directory named by
  `GENERIC_RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR` holding users, roles, API keys, Admin settings,
  and availability state.
