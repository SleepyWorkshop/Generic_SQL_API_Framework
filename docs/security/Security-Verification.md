# Security verification

This is the security verification record for the Generic SQL API Framework
backend: what was verified, how, every finding with its current status, and
the security work that remains. Current controls are described in
[Security model](Security-Model.md); the outstanding external test is scoped in
[Penetration-test preparation](Penetration-Test-Preparation.md).

No password, hash, API key, encryption key, session identifier, or other secret
is reproduced here.

## Current status

- No Critical or High finding is open.
- Every finding below has a recorded status. Open items are design limitations,
  hardening opportunities, or accepted risks, each documented in
  [Security model](Security-Model.md#accepted-risks-and-deployment-responsibilities)
  or [Limitations](../Limitations.md).
- All verification so far was performed against the repository and local,
  isolated deployments. **No deployed production-like host has been tested, and
  the external penetration test has not been performed.**

## Verification history

| Release line | Activity | Date | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| v2.0.0 | Attack-oriented security testing of authentication, sessions, authorization, API keys, CSRF/CORS, SQL/CRUD injection, paths, backups, health, logging, and errors | 2026-09-24 | ST-001 – ST-007; two fixed before release |
| Unreleased (v2.1.1) | Dependency security review | 2026-10-06 | No application dependencies; review-environment runtime updated |
| Unreleased (v2.1.2) | Manual static security analysis of backend, Admin Console, SQL Parser, templates, CI, and Git history | 2026-10-06 | SSA-01 – SSA-20; SSA-01 – SSA-12 remediated or dispositioned |
| Unreleased (v2.1.3) | Authorization and API boundary inventory and 64-test plan | 2026-10-06 | AAPI-01 – AAPI-09; all 64 tests pass (56 over HTTP, 8 at the enforcement layer) |
| Unreleased (v2.1.4) | Passive, unauthenticated DAST of a local development deployment and review of the IIS and Nginx templates; penetration-test preparation | 2026-10-06 | DAST-01 – DAST-05; authenticated dynamic testing deferred |
| Unreleased (v2.1.5) | Security architecture and operational hardening review of code, templates, and documentation | 2026-10-06 | SAOH-01 – SAOH-08; no Critical or High |
| Unreleased (v2.1.6) | Final repository-level verification | 2026-10-07 | No regression and no documentation/code contradiction; all findings dispositioned |

Final verification (v2.1.6) covered:

- the backend regression suite with and without a loaded `php.ini`
  (`php tests/run.php`, `php -n tests/run.php`) and the targeted security suites;
- re-running every mutation check from v2.1.3 – v2.1.5 (each weakened control
  was caught by a test);
- PHP lint, documentation tests, and a secret scan of tracked files, which found
  only synthetic test values, example placeholders, and the fixed login-timing
  placeholder hash;
- a code cross-check of the Admin loopback and `GENERIC_ADMIN_ENABLED` gates, the
  runtime configuration directory, encryption-key handling, query-source and
  routine registries, the result-row limit, readiness, SQL Parser routing,
  session settings, backup signing, and production PHP settings.

Methods and limits that apply across all activities: no external SAST, DAST, or
software-composition scanner was used; no live SQL Server was used, so
database-dependent behavior was reasoned from code; IIS, Nginx/PHP-FPM, real
TLS, and multi-worker load were not executed.

## Findings register

Status terms: **Fixed** (code or configuration changed, regression-tested),
**Documented** (resolved by documented operator guidance), **Accepted**
(intended behavior, documented), **Open** (known limitation or hardening
opportunity), **Deferred** (not in an approved remediation scope yet).

### v2.0.0 security testing (ST)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Resolution / regression coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST-001 | Medium | Unauthenticated or invalid-key requests returned `401` before the API rate limiter, bypassing the limit | Fixed | The anonymous address identity is consumed before `401`. `SecurityTestingTest` |
| ST-002 | Low | CORS origin validation accepted userinfo, query, or fragment unless all were present | Fixed | Each forbidden URL component is rejected independently. `SecurityTestingTest` |
| ST-003 | Medium | No per-role read-column authorization | **Open — design limitation** | Authorization is resource-level. Since v2.1.2 the query-source registry limits JSON Query Mode to registered tables and views with optional per-role restriction, but any column of an authorized source is readable. Expose sensitive columns only through least-privilege views or SQL Resources; column-level policy would be a public-contract change. |
| ST-004 | Low | No independent filter-count limit | **Open — hardening opportunity** | Still no separate limit in the validators. Bounded by the request body limit, API rate limit, query timeout, and worker limits. Measure representative filter usage before adding one. |
| ST-005 | Low | Rate-limit state is single-host | Accepted | Exact only for workers sharing one local filesystem; see SAOH-08 |
| ST-006 | Informational | Plaintext database configuration remains readable for compatibility | Accepted | Production must save or migrate to the encrypted envelope |
| ST-007 | Informational | SQL Parser has no authentication | Accepted | Database-free and non-executing; keep it on a loopback or internal listener (target-host verification) |

### v2.1.2 static security analysis (SSA)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Resolution / regression coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SSA-01 | High | Routine actions could execute any stored procedure or function | Fixed | Deny-by-default `config/routine-resources.php`. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-02 | High | First-run administrator creation was public on the API | Fixed | `setup.createAdmin` is Admin-API-only and gated. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-03 | Medium | JSON Query Mode could read any object the SQL login could read | Fixed for JSON Query, metadata, and SQL Resource runtime filters | Deny-by-default `config/query-sources.php`, reconciled with the sources the frontend uses. Authored SQL Resource SQL is not checked table by table. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-04 | Medium | User and API-key administration exposed on the public API | Fixed | `auth.users.*`, `auth.apiKeys.*`, `auth.roles.list` are Admin-API-only. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-05 | High | An administrator password hash was present in pushed Git history | Cleared | The credential was rotated on 2026-10-06 and verified not to match the historical hash. History was not rewritten. |
| SSA-06 | Low | `frontend.read` is not narrowed by SQL Resource scopes | Accepted | Documented in [Limitations](../Limitations.md). `StaticSecurityRemediationTest`, `AuthorizationApiCoverageTest` |
| SSA-07 | Low | SQL Resource runtime filters could test non-exposed columns | Fixed | Runtime source filters resolve only against registered sources. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-08 | Low | Loopback and rate-limit identity rely on `REMOTE_ADDR` | Documented | Same-host proxies in front of the entry points are forbidden by the deployment guide |
| SSA-09 | Low | ODBC driver auto-detection could fall back to legacy drivers | Fixed | Production uses only ODBC Driver 18/17 and reports weakened transport. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-10 | Informational | Some query literals are inlined with quote doubling | No change | No exploitable path; edge-case tests added. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-11 | Low | Unpaginated reads were not size-bounded | Fixed | `GENERIC_MAX_RESULT_ROWS`, `413 RESULT_TOO_LARGE`. `StaticSecurityRemediationTest` |
| SSA-12 | Low | Bundled Windows PHP runtime was outside the dependency review | Documented | See [Runtime dependencies](#runtime-dependencies) |
| SSA-13 | Informational | Password maximum (1,024) exceeds bcrypt's 72-byte input | Deferred | Unchanged |
| SSA-14 | Informational | `health.php` paths other than `/health/live` and `/health/ready` return version, port, and start time; IIS allows direct `/api/health.php` | Deferred | Unchanged; Nginx maps only the two probes |
| SSA-15 | Informational | Login throttling is per address plus username only | Deferred | Unchanged; the API rate limit partly offsets it |
| SSA-16 | Informational | Anonymous `auth.csrf` calls create sessions on demand | Deferred | Unchanged; bounded by the API rate limit |
| SSA-17 | Informational | CSRF did not cover routine actions | Partly addressed | Registered write routines require CSRF since AAPI-03; read routines are unprotected, like `select` |
| SSA-18 | Informational | AES-GCM envelopes carry no associated data | Deferred | Unchanged |
| SSA-19 | Informational | Dynamic controller dispatch in `api/index.php` | Deferred | Reached only with normalizer-fixed values |
| SSA-20 | Informational | CI uses tag-pinned actions and only PHP 8.2 | Deferred | Unchanged |

### v2.1.3 authorization and API security testing (AAPI)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Resolution / regression coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AAPI-01 | High | Application Administrators could take over or alter backend-only accounts | Fixed | Frontend user management refuses backend identities for every actor. `AuthorizationBoundaryTest`, `FrontendUserMutationAuthorizationTest` |
| AAPI-02 | Medium | System Administrator identities were manageable through the public API | Fixed | Same control. `AuthorizationBoundaryTest`, `FrontendUserMutationAuthorizationTest` |
| AAPI-03 | Low | Routine actions were not CSRF-protected | Fixed | Registered write routines require CSRF. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-04 | Low | Username enumeration and System Administrator profile disclosure to frontend administrators | Fixed | Minimized profiles and uniform not-found responses; `409` on duplicate create/rename accepted. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-05 | Informational | Password changes do not require the current password | Accepted | No self-service or recovery flow; changes are administrator resets. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-06 | Informational | API key privileges are independent of the owner's role | Accepted | Owner must exist and be enabled. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-07 | Informational | Public API accepts a JSON list body | Accepted | Rejected by authentication or authorization (`401`/`403`); no dispatch path. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-08 | Informational | `publicRoles` and `legacyApiKeyRoles` accepted privileged roles | Fixed | System Administrator is rejected; Data Operator for anonymous or legacy-key principals remains an operator choice. `ApiSecurityHardeningTest` |
| AAPI-09 | Informational | A non-string public `action` emitted a PHP warning | Fixed | Rejected cleanly. `AuthorizationApiCoverageTest` |

### v2.1.4 DAST (DAST)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Resolution / regression coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DAST-01 | Low | SQL Parser disclosed the PHP version in `X-Powered-By` | Fixed | Header removed; bundled Linux runtime sets `expose_php = Off`. `DastRegressionTest` |
| DAST-02 | Low | SQL Parser development router executed any PHP file in its document root | Fixed | Router serves only the intended assets. `DastRegressionTest` |
| DAST-03 | Informational | Development static assets have no security headers | Accepted | Development only; production headers come from IIS/Nginx |
| DAST-04 | Informational | Development `/health` reports listener metadata | Accepted | Development only; see SSA-14 for the IIS direct path |
| DAST-05 | Informational | API and Admin development routers pass existing files through | Accepted | Development only; document roots contain no other code |

### v2.1.5 architecture and operational hardening (SAOH)

| ID | Severity | Finding | Status | Resolution / regression coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SAOH-01 | Medium | Runtime state shared a writable directory with executable configuration | Fixed | Runtime configuration lives in `GENERIC_RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR` outside the code tree; `Backend/config` is read-only; `validate-production.php` reports the location. `OperationalHardeningTest` |
| SAOH-02 | Low | Development PHP runtimes were writable by the production pool | Fixed | Deployment ACLs keep them read-only. `OperationalHardeningTest` |
| SAOH-03 | Low | Readiness at `/api/health/ready` always reported healthy | Fixed | Probes recognized by final path segments. `OperationalHardeningTest` |
| SAOH-04 | Informational | Boundaries share one worker identity | Accepted | Optional dedicated parser pool |
| SAOH-05 | Informational | Default backup-signing key shares host and identity with the archives | Accepted | Supply the key from a vault |
| SAOH-06 | Informational | `db_datareader` grants read on every table | Accepted | Use narrower grants where possible |
| SAOH-07 | Informational | Log rotation, retention, and central collection are external | Accepted | Deployment responsibility |
| SAOH-08 | Informational | Security state is single-host | Accepted | Keep one application host |

## Runtime dependencies

The application has no Composer, npm, vendored, or external-include
dependencies. Its dependency surface is the host PHP runtime and extensions,
operating-system libraries, and the ODBC stack (driver manager and Microsoft
ODBC Driver for SQL Server). Production hosts install and patch these
themselves; repeat a version-currency review whenever PHP, the operating
system, or the ODBC stack changes, and before each release. The v2.1.1 review
was a version-currency check against local package metadata, not a
vulnerability scan.

The repository also tracks a portable Windows PHP runtime in
`runtime/windows/php/` for `start-windows.bat` only; IIS deployments use a
separately installed PHP.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Component | PHP 8.5.10, Thread Safe, x64, Visual C++ 2022 (VS17) build |
| Bundled OpenSSL | 3.5.7 |
| Provenance | Build metadata matches the official windows.php.net release pipeline; the original download URL and archive checksum were not recorded |
| Integrity record | [Windows-PHP-Runtime.sha256](Windows-PHP-Runtime.sha256), verified with `sha256sum -c docs/security/Windows-PHP-Runtime.sha256` from the repository root |

Compare the bundle with current PHP 8.5 and OpenSSL 3.5 security releases when
the dependency review is repeated, and record the official archive URL and
checksum on the next update.

## Deferred security work

- **External penetration test**, including authenticated dynamic testing,
  session and rate-limit testing over HTTPS, injection testing against a SQL
  Server test database, dynamic SQL Parser input testing, TLS and deployed IIS
  or Nginx behavior, and the Admin loopback boundary behind production hosting.
  See [Penetration-test preparation](Penetration-Test-Preparation.md).
- **Target-host verification** of ACLs, effective `php.ini`, session storage,
  and live SQL Server behavior (operator-owned).
- **SSA-13 – SSA-16, SSA-18 – SSA-20** and the read-routine part of SSA-17.
- **ST-003** column-level read authorization and **ST-004** filter-count limit.
- Optional Admin MFA.

Record future verification and its findings here, and add a regression test for
each remediated finding.
